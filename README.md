## Basic MLB Stats App

This is a basic app that navigates the public MLB API. You can explore MLB teams, their rosters, and their player's stats. 

It was made with React, Material-UI, D3, and more.

You can find the app here: http://www.basicbaseballdata.com/

Alternatively, you can `git clone https://github.com/JulienAssouline/Baseball-team-and-player-app.git` the repo, then cd into the root directory, run `yarn` then run `yarn start`.
